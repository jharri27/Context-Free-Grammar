Project Description:

For this assignment, I received a collection of sentences.  My instructions were to write a context free grammar for a small subset of English, providing rule changes that allowed for the unique structure of each sentence.

Instructions:
Please copy all files into the same folder, and open the Jupyter Notebook in your Python editing software.
